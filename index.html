                In 2017, I received my diploma in Software Practical
                Engineering.
                <br />
                This foundational education provided me with a solid
                understanding of software development principles,
                problem-solving skills, and a passion for technology.
                <br />
                In 2018, I moved to Germany to seek new opportunities and pursue
                a long-term career in web development. <br />

                I am based in Berlin, I am set to complete my studies as a web
                developer in February 2025.
                <br />
                My education at DCI has exposed me to a wide range of web
                technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various
                frameworks. <br />
                I have learned frameworks such as React, Tailwind CSS, and
                Bootstrap, which have enabled me to develop interactive and
                responsive web applications.

                I have a strong passion for front-end development and design.
                <br />
                I enjoy creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces
                that provide seamless user experiences.
                <br />
                My skills include responsive web design, UI/UX principles, and
                working with tools like Canva, Figma and PicsArt.
                <br />
                I am always eager to learn and explore new technologies to stay
                updated in this fast-paced industry.

                >
                I’ve built a diverse background in customer support, sales, and
                data analysis, which has given me valuable insights into what
                users need and how to meet those needs effectively. <br />

                As a Content Moderator at Majorel in Berlin, I was responsible
                for ensuring that social media content aligned with community
                standards. <br />
                This role sharpened my attention to detail and helped me
                understand the importance of clear communication online. <br />
                Before that, I worked at Concentrix as a Customer Support Agent,
                where I provided technical support to advertisers and business
                owners. <br />
                I handled inquiries via chat, email, and calls, helping
                customers understand how to make the most of their advertising
                solutions.
                <br />

                I also took on a freelance role with Proonto on a travel project
                called Issta, where I responded to customer inquiries in
                real-time. <br />
                This job taught me how to manage customer complaints and provide
                quick solutions in a fast-paced environment. <br />

                Before diving into customer service, I was a Data Analyst at
                Refinitiv, focusing on the Israeli stock exchange market. <br />
                I worked on a translation project where I corrected software
                translations, which helped me hone my analytical skills. <br />

                My earlier experience includes various sales positions at G3
                Communications Solutions (Celltech LTD), where I managed a team
                and handled customer relations in a cellular shop. I balanced
                managing day-to-day operations with providing great service to
                both private and business customers. <br />

                I also worked at K.S.P Computers and Cellular and Top Mobile,
                where I focused on sales and customer service, helping customers
                with everything from purchasing products to resolving issues
                with returns. <br />
                This gave me a strong foundation in managing customer
                experiences and understanding the sales process. <br />

                Overall, my experiences have equipped me with a well-rounded
                skill set that combines technical knowledge with a strong focus
                on customer satisfaction. <br />
                I’m excited to bring this background into my work as a web
                developer, where I can create user-friendly and effective web
                applications. <br />

                  >Work Eligibility and Future Goals
                </span>
                As a Portuguese citizen, an EU member state, I am eligible to
                work immediately without needing additional documents or visas.
                <br />
                Upon completing my Weiterbildung at DCI in February 2025, I will
                be seeking either a two-month internship or a permanent position
                to begin my professional journey.
                <br />
                I am particularly interested in roles that focus on front-end
                development, where I can contribute my skills while learning
                from experienced professionals.
                <br />
                Additionally, I am open to learning new technologies and
                techniques related to web development to enhance my skill set
                and adapt to the evolving industry.
