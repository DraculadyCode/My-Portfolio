              Often referred to as
              <strong>"The Typographer's Bible",</strong> Chapter 6 of The
              Elements of Typographic Stylecovers Choosing and Combining Type.
              Bringhurst reminds us to
              <strong>
                "Choose faces that will survive, and if possible prosper, in the
                final screen conditions"</strong
              >
              and to "choose faces that suit the task as well as the subject."
              He tells us to "start with a single typographic family," but when
              the time comes to combine fonts, "balance the type optically more
              than mathematically.

              for ideas and a love for the letters and words used to make ideas
              visible.The Elements of Typographic Style teaches the basics of
              honoring and respecting the written word -- through choosing and
              combining typefaces; striving for rhythm, proportion, and harmony;
              and designing typographic pages.

            <p><em>by John Boardley</em></p>
            <p>
              From the website: I love Typography (ILT) was born on August 7,
              2007. It exists because I have a passion for typography, type
              design, and lettering, and for the words born of those
              disciplines. As a child I wondered why the teacher asked us to
              draw the letter a as an o with a tail, when in my books, the a’s
              had an extra bit at the top. This site aims to make the subject
              more accessible, to bring the study of typography to the masses,
              if you will. It's just about impossible to imagine a world without
              type, but at the same time type's ubiquity has most of us taking
              it for granted. So take a closer look.

              Ben Shahn was a muralist, photographer, and printmaker whose work
              often including lettering. When he was 14, he was apprenticed to a
              lithographer. In Love and Joy About Letters he writes: "I
              discovered the Roman alphabet in all its elegance and its austere
              dignity, and I fell in love all over again with letters… Letters
              are quantities, and spaces are quantities, and only the eye and
              the hand can measure them. As in the ear and the sensibilities of
              the poet sounds and syllables and pauses are quantities, so in
              both cases are the balancing and forward movement of these
              quantities only a matter of skill and feeling and art.
