      <p>
        As in other pet species, a variety of colors, coat types, and other
        features that do not appear in the wild have either been developed, or
        have appeared spontaneously. <br />
        Fancy rats in themselves are a subspecies and as such do not have
        distinctive breeds. <br />
        Any individual rat may be defined one or more ways by its color, coat,
        marking, and non-standard body type. <br />
        This allows for very specific classifications such as a ruby-eyed
        cinnamon Berkshire rex Dumbo.

      <h2 id="coloring">Coloring</h2>
      <p>
        While some pet rats retain the agouti coloring of the wild brown rat
        (three tones on the same hair), others have solid colors (a single color
        on each hair), a trait derived from rats with black coats. <br />
        Agouti-based colors include agouti, cinnamon, and fawn. <br />
        Black-based colors include black, beige, blue, and chocolate. <br />

        Eye color is considered a subset of coloring, and coat color definitions
        often include standards for the eyes, as many genes which control eye
        color will also affect the coat color or vice versa. <br />
        The American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association (AFRMA) lists black, pink,
        ruby, and odd-eyed (two differently colored eyes) as possible eye
        colors, depending on the variety of rat shown. <br />
        Ruby refers to eyes which at a glance appear black, but on closer
        observation are a deep, dark red. <br />

        Color names can vary for more vaguely defined varieties, like lilac and
        fawn, while the interpretations of standards can fluctuate between (and
        even within) different countries or clubs.

      <h2 id="markings">Markings</h2>

      <p>
        Himalayan rats have a unique color and marking variation Further
        dividing the varieties of fancy rats are the many different markings.
        <br />
        Fancy rats can appear in any combination of colors and markings. <br />
        The markings are typically in reference to the patterns and ratios of
        colored hair versus white hair. <br />
        Two extremes would be a self (completely solid, non-white color) and a
        Himalayan (completely white except blending into colored areas at the
        nose and feet, called points, as in a Himalayan cat's markings). <br />

        Markings have a strict standard, with detailed terminology, for showing
        in fancy rat pet shows. <br />
        <img src="../images/painting rats3.webp" alt="Painting rats" /> <br />
        However, many domestic rats are not closely bred to any color standard;
        <br />
        many of those found in pet shops will have mismarkings from a formal
        breeding perspective, which are defined as variations in markings that
        are not recognized as conforming to a breed standard published by a rat
        fancier organisation. <br />
      </p>
      <a href="#top">Back to top</a>

      <h3>Commonly recognized standards include:</h3>

      <p>
        Berkshire – colored top, white belly hooded – color runs in a saddle, a
        single, unbroken line from the full head down to the spine and possibly
        partly down the tail. <br />
        capped – color on the full head only. <br />
        blazed – colored head (capped) or body (Irish, Berkshire or self) with a
        triangular wedge of white fur over the face. <br />
        variegated – any form of mismatched oddities in the fur. Can be anything
        from a broken or spotted hood to a misshaped blaze. <br />
        Irish or English Irish – In England, the Irish is standardized by the
        NFRS as an equilateral triangle of white with a side that begins at the
        chest, or between the front legs, and where the point ends mid-length.
        <br />
        In the United States and elsewhere, clubs like the AFRMA distinguish
        this marking as the English Irish and allow for another standardized
        Irish in which the rat may have white of an even or symmetrical nature
        anywhere along its underside. <br />
        Other marking varieties include spotted or Dalmatian (named for the
        spotted Dalmatian dog), Essex, masked, Himalayan (typically a gradient
        of color along the body, darkest at the base of the tail and nose as in
        Siamese cats), and Down Under or Downunder (an Australian variety that
        has a solid color stripe on the belly or a color marking there that
        corresponds to the markings on the top).

      <a href="#top">Back to top</a>

      <h2 id="bodytype">Body Type</h2>
      <p>
        A male Dumbo rat, a variety with ears placed lower on the head Two of
        the most prominent and standardized physical changes applied to rats
        through selective breeding are the development of the Manx rat and Dumbo
        rat. <br />
        The Dumbo rat, whose origins are in the United States, is characterized
        by having large, low, round ears on the sides of its head caused by a
        recessive mutation, and was named for its resemblance to the fictional
        character Dumbo the Flying Elephant. <br />
        The Manx rat is tailless due to a genetic mutation, and was named for
        the Manx cat which shares this feature, though not necessarily due to
        the same mutation. <br />
        Breeding Manx rats does raise some ethical and health concerns however,
        as rats use their tails for both balance and thermoregulation. <br />
        <img src="../images/babies and mother.webp" alt="Babies and mother" />
        <br />

        Dwarf fancy rats are much smaller than standards. <br />
        Another body type variation that has risen to prominence more recently
        in the hobby is the Dwarf rat. <br />
        Dwarfism arose as a mutation among Sprague-Dawley rats kept for research
        in the 1970s. <br />
        Adult dwarfs are considerably smaller than their standard counterparts,
        with males between 100 and 130g as opposed to 300g or more. <br />
        This strain of dwarfism is caused by reduced production of growth
        hormone, and this has other effects in addition to changed overall body
        size. <br />
        Important for pet-keeping, it reduces the incidence of pituitary and
        mammary tumours and nephropathy (liver disease), with the result that
        Dwarf rats live 20–40% longer in males and 10–20% longer in females than
        their standard counterparts. <br />

        However, they may also show some cognitive impairment.
      </p>
      <a href="#top">Back to top</a>

      <h2 id="coattypes">Coat Types</h2>
      <p>
        There is a relatively small variety of coats compared to the number of
        colors and markings, and not all are internationally standardized. The
        most common type is the normal or standard, which is allowed variance in
        coarseness between the sexes; <br />
        males have a coarse, thick, rough coat, while females' coats are softer
        and finer. <br />
        Other standardized coats include: rex, in which all the hairs are curly,
        even the whiskers; <br />
        velveteen, a softer variation of the rex; <br />
        satin or silky coat, which is extra-soft and fine, with a sheen; and
        Harley, characterized by wispy long straight hairs. <br />Remaining coat
        types are not defined by the hair itself, but rather by the lack of it,
        such as hairless rats.
      </p>
      <a href="#top">Back to top</a>

      <h2 id="hairlessrats">Hairless Rats</h2>
      <p>
        Even though this rat is hairless, pigmentation indicates that it is a
        hooded rat. <br />
        See also: Hairless laboratory rats Hairless rats are a coat variety
        characterized by varying levels of hair loss. <br />
        One type of hairless rat is bred from curly-coated rexes. <br />
        These range from having areas of very short fur to being completely
        bald. <br />
        <img src="../images/Hairless_rat_Lhassa.webp" alt="Hairless rats" />
        <br />
        Since rex is a dominant trait, there only needs to be one rex parent to
        produce curly rex-coated offspring. <br />
        However, when two rex parents are bred, two copies of the trait may be
        present in the offspring. <br />
        This causes varying levels of hairlessness, and has earned the
        colloquial name "double rex". <br />
        The other type of hairless rat is sometimes referred to as a "true
        hairless". <br />
        This is caused by a different gene, and is distinguishable from a
        hairless double rex by the absence of whiskers. <br />
        Unlike a double rex, this type of hairless rat is incapable of growing
        hairs on any part of the body. <br />
        One additional subset of semi-hairless rats, patchwork rex, constantly
        lose their hair and regrow it in different "patches" several times
        throughout their life. <br />
        Hairless rats may be prone to more health problems than their standard-
        or rex-coated counterparts, including a reduced tolerance for cold,
        kidney and liver failure, more prone to skin injury, skin conditions,
        and shortened life span.

      <h2 id="ethics">Ethics Of Selective Breeding</h2>
      <p>
        There is controversy among rat fanciers in regard to selective breeding.
        <br />
        On one hand, breeding rats to "conform" to a specific standard or to
        develop a new one is a large part of what the fancy was founded on.
        <br />
        On the other hand, the process results in many rats who do not
        "conform", and are then either given away, sold as food, or killed—the
        latter referred to as culling. <br />

        There are concerns as to whether breeding hairless and tailless rats is
        ethical. <br />
        The tail is vital for rats' balance and for adjusting body temperature.
        Tailless rats have greater risk of heat exhaustion, poor bowel and
        bladder control, falling from heights, and can be at risk for
        life-threatening deformities in the pelvic region, like hind leg
        paralysis and megacolon. <br />
        <img
          src="../images/wZyGLBmgnRd6qtbS1eWC_1082048577.webp"
          alt="Sleeping rat"
        />
        <br />
        Similarly, hairless rats are less protected from scratches and the cold
        without their coat. <br />
        Groups such as the NFRS prohibit the showing of these varieties at their
        events and forbid advertisement through affiliated services.

      <h2 id="availability">Availability</h2>
      <p>
        Because R. norvegicus and related species are seen as pests, their
        intentional import into foreign countries is often regulated. <br />
        For example, the importation of foreign rodents is prohibited in
        Australia, and so various coat types, colors, and varieties have been
        bred separately from foreign lines, or are just not obtainable within
        that country (for example, hairless and Dumbo rats do not exist in
        Australia). <br />
        <img

          alt="Baby rat"
        />
        <br />
        In other areas, like the Canadian province of Alberta, which is
        considered rat-free, the ownership of domestic fancy rats outside of
        schools, laboratories, and zoos is illegal.
