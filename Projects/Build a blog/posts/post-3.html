      Human-raised R. norvegicus are more prone to specific health risks and
      diseases than their wild counterparts, but they are also far less likely
      to succumb to certain illnesses that are prevalent in the wild. <br />
      The major considerations for susceptibility include exposure, living
      conditions, and diet. <br />

      Rats that live their entire lives indoors usually are able to avoid
      disease-causing bacteria such as Salmonella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa;
      <br />
      the latter is absent in treated water. <br />

      They may also more easily avoid vectors like cockroaches, beetles, and
      fleas which are essential for the spread of endemic typhus and intestinal
      parasites like the rat tapeworm. <br />
      Additionally, pet or laboratory rats enjoy the intrinsic benefits of
      having a consistent and well-balanced diet, along with access to medical
      care. <br />

      Porphyrin is a browny-red substance that fancy rats can develop around the
      eyes and nose. <br />

      <br />
      It may appear like dried blood, <br />
      but is a mucus-like substance that is released at times of stress or if
      the rat has a respiratory infection. <br />
      It can also be caused by temporary irritation in the eye, such as the rat
      accidentally scratching its eye while grooming. <br />

      Mites also pose a health risk. <br />
      Mites are microscopic bloodsucking parasites that can irritate the skin of
      fancy rats, and if they have a preexisting health condition, it can cause
      them to die from their bodies' inability to handle two problems at once.
      <br />

      While living indoors decreases the risk of contracting certain diseases,
      living in close quarters with other rats, lack of proper protection from
      environmental factors (e.g. temperature, humidity), an unhealthy diet, and
      the stresses inherently associated with living in an unnatural habitat can
      all adversely affect a rat's health to make them more prone to specific
      conditions. <br />
      <img src="../images/cuterat.webp" alt="Cute rat" /> <br />
      Specifically, Tyzzer's disease, protozoic infections (e.g. Giardia muris),
      and pseudotuberculosis are usually seen in stressed or young rats. <br />
      Additionally, pet rats are exposed to Streptococcus pneumoniae, a zoonotic
      disease caught from humans, not the same bacteria associated with
      pneumonia. <br />
      A human-associated fungus, Pneumocystis carinii (also found in almost all
      domesticated animals), is usually asymptomatic in the rat, unless the
      rat's immune system is compromised by illness. <br />
      If this occurs, the infection can develop into pneumonia. <br />

      Several diseases, like Rat Coronavirus Infection (RCI), Sendai virus, and
      Murine Respiratory Mycoplasmosis (MRM, Mycoplasma pulmonis), are prevalent
      simply because their highly contagious natures work in tandem with the way
      rats are kept in laboratories, pet stores, and by breeders. <br />
      MRM is far less likely to occur in laboratory rats than in those kept as
      pets. <br />

      Pet rats can also develop pituitary tumors if fed high-calorie diets,[35]
      and ringtail if placed in areas with low humidity or high temperatures.
      <br />
      Staphylococcus spp. are a mostly benign group of bacteria that commonly
      reside on the top of the skin, but cuts and scratches from social and
      hierarchical fighting can open up the pathways for them to cause
      ulcerative dermatitis. <br />
      <img src="../images/FSss_x3VsAIHG-h.webp" alt="Baby dumbo-rex rat" />
      <br />

      There is some evidence that spayed female rats ("does") are less likely to
      develop mammary and pituitary tumors than intact females. <br />
      Research into prevention of common diseases and health issues in rats is
      ongoing. <br />
      Dietary changes are among the main suggestions for improved health and
      longevity in fancy rats, including feeding rat-friendly superfoods in
      moderation to reduce the risk of cancers, heart disease, and stroke.

    <h2>Risks to owners</h2>
    <p>
      Keeping rats as pets can come with the stigma that rats supposedly
      transmit dangerous diseases to their owners. <br />Usually, rats bred as
      pets are tested and treated for diseases and parasites. <br />
      One fear is that all rats carry plague, when in fact R. norvegicus is not
      among the list of species considered a threat. <br />
      In 2004, an outbreak of salmonella in the United States was connected to
      people who owned pet rats. <br />
      However, it has been determined that a pet rat's initial exposure to
      salmonella, along with many other zoonotic rat diseases, typically
      indicates exposure to wild rodent populations, either from an infestation
      in the owner's home, or from the pet's contaminated food, water, or
      bedding. <br />

      Another risk to rat owners is rat-bite fever. <br />This is a rare disease
      among domesticated rats and is most often found in rats from large chain
      pet stores that breed their stock of rats in masses (usually with the
      intention of being snake food rather than pets) or from breeders with
      neglectful rat husbandry. <br />
      This disease is fairly unnoticeable in the rat, but is characterized by
      swelling of the bite or scratch site, fever, vomiting, and body aches.
      <br />
      It is contracted by the bite or scratch of an infected rat. <br />
      As an early breeder of fancy rats, Jack Black recounted that he nearly
      died several times after bites. <br />

      In 2017, the Centers for Disease Control reported an outbreak of Seoul
      virus spread by pet rats.
