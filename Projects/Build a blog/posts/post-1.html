      <h1 id="top">Differences from wild rats</h1>
      <p>
        While domesticated rats are not removed enough from their wild
        counterparts to justify a distinct species (like the dog versus grey
        wolf), there are significant differences that set them apart; <br />
        the most apparent is coloring. <br />
        Random color mutations may occur in the wild, but these are rare. Most
        wild R. norvegicus are a dark brown color, while fancy rats may be
        anything from white to cinnamon to blue. <br />

        Behaviorally, domesticated pet rats are tamer than those in the wild.
        <br />
        They are more comfortable around humans and known to seek out their
        owners while roaming freely. <br />
        They have decreased reactions to light and sound, are less cautious of
        new food, and have better tolerance to overcrowding. <br />
        Domesticated rats are shown to mate earlier, more readily, and for a
        longer period of time over their lifespan. <br />
        Also, domesticated rats exhibit different behaviors when fighting with
        each other: <br />
        while wild rats almost always flee a lost battle, caged rats spend
        protracted amounts of time in a belly-up or boxing position. <br />These
        behavioral traits are thought to be products of environment as opposed
        to genetics. <br />

        However, it is also theorized that there are certain underlying
        biological reasons for why some members of a wild species are more
        receptive to domestication than others, and that these differences are
        then passed down to offspring (compare domesticated silver fox). <br />

        The body structure of domesticated rats differs from that of a wild rat
        as well. <br />
        The body of a fancy rat is smaller, with larger ears and a longer tail.
        Domesticated rats have generally smaller and sharper facial features as
        well. <br />

        Domesticated rats have a longer lifespan than that of wild rats. <br />
        Because domesticated rats are protected from predators and have ready
        access to food, water, shelter, and medical care, their average lifespan
        is around two to three years, in contrast to wild Rats. <br />
        norvegicus, which average a lifespan of less than one year. <br />
        However, wild rats generally have larger brains, hearts, livers,
        kidneys, and adrenal glands than laboratory rats. <br />
        The fancy rat and wild rat also each face a multitude of differing
        health concerns; <br />
        the former is at risk of developing a pneumococcal infection from
        exposure to humans, while the latter may harbor tapeworms after coming
        in contact with carriers such as cockroaches and fleas.
