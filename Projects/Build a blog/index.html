      <h1>Fancy Rats</h1>
      <p><strong>Welcome to my first blog</strong></p>
      <p>
        The fancy rat (Rattus norvegicus domestica) is the domesticated form of
        Rattus norvegicus, the brown rat,and the most common species of rat kept
        as a pet. <br />
        The name fancy rat derives from the use of the adjective fancy for a
        hobby, also seen in "animal fancy", a hobby involving the appreciation,
        promotion, or breeding of pet or domestic animals. <br />
        The offspring of wild-caught specimens, having become docile after
        having been bred for many generations, fall under the fancy type. <br />
        Fancy rats were originally targets for blood sport in 18th- and
        19th-century Europe. <br />
        Later bred as pets, they now come in a wide variety of coat colors and
        patterns, and are bred and raised by several rat enthusiast groups
        around the world. <br />
        They are sold in pet stores and by breeders. Fancy rats are generally
        quite affordable, even compared to other small pets; this is one of
        their biggest draws. <br />
        Additionally, they are quite independent, affectionate, loyal and easily
        trained. <br />
        They are considered more intelligent than other domesticated rodents.
        <br />
        Healthy fancy rats typically live 2 to 3 years, but are capable of
        living a year or so longer. <br />
        Fancy rats are used widely in medical research, as their physiology is
        similar to human physiology. <br />
        When used in this field, they are referred to as laboratory rats (lab
        rats). <br />
        Domesticated rats are physiologically and psychologically different from
        their wild relatives, and typically pose no more of a health risk than
        other common pets. <br />
        For example, domesticated brown rats are not considered a disease
        threat, although exposure to wild rat populations could introduce
        pathogens like the bacteria Streptobacillus moniliformis into the home.
        <br />
        Fancy rats have different health risks from their wild counterparts, and
        thus are unlikely to succumb to the same illnesses as wild rats.

          While domesticated rats are not removed enough from their wild
          counterparts to justify a distinct species (like the dog versus grey
          wolf), there are significant differences that set them apart; the most
          apparent is coloring. Random color mutations may occur in the wild,
          but these are rare. Most wild R. norvegicus are a dark brown color,
          while fancy rats may be anything from white to cinnamon to blue.

        <p>
          As in other pet species, a variety of colors, coat types, and other
          features that do not appear in the wild have either been developed, or
          have appeared spontaneously. Fancy rats in themselves are a subspecies
          and as such do not have distinctive breeds. Any individual rat may be
          defined one or more ways by its color, coat, marking, and non-standard
          body type. This allows for very specific classifications such as a
          ruby-eyed cinnamon Berkshire rex Dumbo.

        <p>
          Human-raised R. norvegicus are more prone to specific health risks and
          diseases than their wild counterparts, but they are also far less
          likely to succumb to certain illnesses that are prevalent in the wild.
          The major considerations for susceptibility include exposure, living
          conditions, and diet.
