# Display Window Size

Create a React component that dynamically displays the window’s inner width when the window is resized.  Use the effect hook to attach an event listener to the window object that listens for resize events.  Remove the event listener from the window object during cleanup.  Use the event listener’s callback function to set a state variable windowWidth.  Display the value of windowWidth on the page.

## Bonus

Add a button for removing the component.
