This exercise is about practicing `useContext` combined with `useReducer`.

Your task is to add a shopping cart feature into a mock eCommerce website.

## Requirements

- Once the user clicks `+` for a product, that product gets added to the shopping cart
- The user can remove a product from the shopping cart as well
- Store which products are in the cart in a Context
- Control the context by dispatching Reducer actions
- The planned files are already created, but if you wish you can create more
